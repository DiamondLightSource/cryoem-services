    A cryoEM service (eventually) to create composite images from component image

    This will (eventually) take a message (JSON dictionary) containing the image stack
    and metadata files associated with an image series, along with settings for how
    the stacks should be processed (a flattened 2D image or a 3D image stack).

    - Align image stacks for a given position to one another
    - Colourise the image stacks
